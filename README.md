This is a simple Internet-of-Things demo project featuring a Tessel and the Meteor JS framework.
--------

The code inside the tessel folder is the code needed for the Tessel. In order to make it run on your Tessel you need to do two things:
1. Enter your wifi password and SSID in the code where it says so
2. Make sure that your Climate sensor is also of the type si7020. According to the Tessel tutorial they're also shipping a si7005. Just change the name accordingly and if you do member to run npm install.

The code inside the dashboard is the code necessary to run the meteor dashboard. Just create a new meteor project and copy the code into it.
